				Internet is a system of PC frameworks that have been associated with one another utilizing standard correspondence conventions. The web offers access to an enormous volume of valuable and helpful data. Web tasks started when the US Department of Defense associated a few PCs through optical link systems. These systems likewise utilized satellites for transmission of information to faraway places. Both Government and private associations give the Internet administration.

            We can watch movies, listen to songs, play games and do so many things. If you feel lonely, you can video call your friends. We stay informed about events around us, by the news received on the internet. It is so much informative that you feel addicted to it. Whatever you wish you get on the internet.

There is no doubt that the internet is useful. But, there is also a little risk involved. We should use the internet sensibly. Children should use it under supervision. Use it only when necessary. Do not overindulge as it might harm you. It can be distractive if used longer. You may lose your concentration and memory power. You will also find it difficult to study. There is also a risk of leaking private information on the internet.
